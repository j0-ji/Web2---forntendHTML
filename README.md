# RealWorld API - UI Prototype
This is only a Prototype created for the "Web-Engineering 2"-course (University of Applied Sciences Stralsund). I created it using the [templates](https://realworld-docs.netlify.app/docs/specs/frontend-specs/templates/) from the RealWorld docs.

It has two different main directories. The `/preLogin` represents the UI when the user is not logged in. In contrast the `/postLogin` directory represents the UI after the User is logged in.

To view both sites just open the according `index.html` in the browser of your choice. I tried to make most links to link to sub-pages, but because it's a prototype you may run into a "404 Not Found"-error.
